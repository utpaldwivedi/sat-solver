* A SAT Solver build fully using C++ which solves a given input of CNF formulas in DIMACS format and returns either NULL or a Model ans if a solution exists.

# Requirements

   * C++14 or newer version.

   * input cnf file

# Input and Output

   * The input test case file.

   * The relative path of the input file must be given in the command line as an argument.

# Compiling and Running the C++ file

   * Open a new terminal where the c++ file is located.

   * Run the following command to compile the code -

   * g++ -o yourfilename.exe sat_solver.cpp 

   * Run the following command to run the exe file generated above.
  
   * ./yourfilename.exe yourinputcnffile.cnf

   * where, yourfilename.exe is the relative path of the input cnf file.
